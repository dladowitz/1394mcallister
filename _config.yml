# Neighboorhood
neighboorhood-background-image-url: "http://img.sfbay.ca/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/alamo.jpg"
neighboorhood-name: Alamo Square
neighboorhood-description: Centered on its namesake park, Alamo Square provides snapshot-worthy views of San Francisco’s iconic Victorian architecture (you might recognize the “Painted Ladies” of Full House fame).  Well located in the heart of San Francisco, Alamo Square features an appealing blend of large mansions, condominiums, and multi-unit properties.  It is a virtual treasure trove of Italianate Victorians which were saved from the 1906 fire and earthquake.  Known as a fun and tranquil neighborhood with bustling restaurants, shops, and venues along Divisadero, historical churches strewn throughout the neighborhood, and one of San Francisco's most iconic parks at its core, neighborhood residents are proud to call Alamo Square home. Alamo Square also benefits from its proximity to adjacent neighborhoods - Hayes Valley, Lower Pacific Heights, NOPA, and Haight Ashbury, as well as many tech shuttles in the area.
